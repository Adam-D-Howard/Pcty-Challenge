# Pcty-Challenge
Code challenge for Pcty

This is the source code for the Paylocity challenge issued to me.  I used Ionic-Angular for the development.

To run the code you'll need to have Node.JS installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Visual Studio Code (VSC) with the extension Angular Language Service.

Once you have the files copied to where you want to work with them, you can open VSC.  With VSC open, you need to open a terminal.  In the terminal run the "NPM INSTALL" command to create the required NODE_MODULES folder and populate it.

Now you can run the code with the command "Ionic serve".
